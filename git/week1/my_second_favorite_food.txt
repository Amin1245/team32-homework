Ingredients (Serves 4–6):
For the Rice:
3 cups basmati rice (washed and soaked for 1–2 hours in salted water)
2 tablespoons salt (for boiling water)
3–4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup brewed saffron (a few strands dissolved in 2–3 tablespoons hot water)
For the Carrot Mixture:
4 large carrots (peeled and julienned or grated)
2–3 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter
1/3 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
1/3 cup orange juice (optional for extra flavor)
1 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional, for fragrance)
1/4 cup slivered almonds or pistachios (lightly toasted)
1/4 cup raisins (optional)
For the Protein (Optional):
500g chicken thighs or breast (or lamb, cut into pieces)
1 medium onion, sliced
1 teaspoon turmeric
Salt and black pepper to taste
1/4 cup water
2–3 tablespoons vegetable oil
Instructions:
1. Cook the Rice:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the salt.
Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook for about 6–8 minutes until the rice is slightly soft but still firm in the center (parboiled).
Drain the rice in a colander and rinse briefly with cool water.
2. Prepare the Carrot Mixture:
Heat the oil or butter in a pan over medium heat.
Add the julienned or grated carrots and sauté for 5–7 minutes until soft and slightly caramelized.
Stir in the sugar, orange juice, cardamom, and raisins (if using). Cook for another 2–3 minutes.
Add the toasted slivered almonds or pistachios and set aside.
3. Prepare the Protein (Optional):
In a separate pan, heat the oil and sauté the onions until golden.
Add the chicken (or lamb) pieces, turmeric, salt, and black pepper. Cook until browned on all sides.
Add a splash of water, cover, and simmer for 20–30 minutes until fully cooked. Set aside.
4. Layer the Rice:
In a large nonstick pot, add a layer of oil or butter. You can also place thinly sliced potatoes or flatbread at the bottom for a crispy tahdig.
Layer the parboiled rice and the carrot mixture in alternating layers, starting and ending with rice.
Pour the brewed saffron evenly over the top of the rice.
Cover the pot with a lid wrapped in a clean kitchen towel (to absorb steam) and cook on low heat for 30–40 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy.
5. Serve:
Gently mix the rice and carrot layers before serving or serve them layered.
Plate the Havij Polo with the cooked chicken or lamb on the side.
Garnish with extra slivered almonds, pistachios, or saffron, if desired.

Ingredients (Serves 4–6):
2 cups fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, and chives or green onions, finely chopped)
1 cup fenugreek leaves (fresh or 2 tablespoons dried; optional, but highly recommended)
1 large onion, finely chopped
400g (14 oz) stew meat (beef or lamb, cubed)
1 cup dried red kidney beans (soaked overnight) or 1 can (rinsed and drained)
3–4 dried Persian limes (limoo amani) or the juice of 1 fresh lime
1 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
Salt to taste
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2–3 tablespoons tomato paste (optional for variation)
4 cups water
Instructions:
Prepare the Herbs:

Wash and finely chop the parsley, cilantro, and chives (or green onions).
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan and sauté the herbs with fenugreek over medium heat for 10 minutes until fragrant. Set aside.
Cook the Meat:

In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and sauté the chopped onion until golden.
Add the cubed meat and turmeric. Stir well to coat the meat.
Cook until the meat is browned on all sides.
Add Beans and Water:

If using dried kidney beans, drain and rinse them.
Add the beans to the pot with 4 cups of water.
Simmer for about 30 minutes.
Add Herbs and Seasonings:

Add the sautéed herbs to the pot along with salt, black pepper, and dried Persian limes (pierce the limes with a fork to release their flavor).
If using tomato paste, stir it in at this stage.
Simmer:

Cover the pot and let the stew simmer over low heat for 1.5–2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Add more water if needed to maintain a stew-like consistency.
Adjust and Serve:

Taste and adjust the seasoning (salt, pepper, or lime juice if needed).
Serve hot with steamed basmati rice, often garnished with saffron
